## üéØ What is Veri-Sign?

Veri-Sign creates a **"Web of Trust"** for digital content by combining blockchain authentication with organizational reputation. In an era of AI-generated content and misinformation, we need more than just "is this real?" - we need **"is this from a trusted source?"**

### The Problem
- AI-generated fakes are indistinguishable from real content
- No way to verify if content comes from trusted organizations
- Anonymous blockchain signatures don't establish credibility
- Readers can't distinguish between random wallets and verified journalists

### The Solution: Two-Layer Verification

**Layer 1: Core Attestation**
- Anyone can create immutable, timestamped signatures for content
- File hash stored on Algorand blockchain linked to wallet address
- Proves authenticity and ownership

**Layer 2: Organizational Reputation**
- Verified organizations mint non-transferable credential ASAs
- Credentials distributed to verified members (journalists, researchers)
- Verification shows "‚úì Verified by Reuters" instead of wallet addresses
- Creates true organizational accountability

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract (Algorand)

**Deployed Contract:** [747976847 on TestNet](https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/application/747976847)

```python
class VerisignApp(ARC4Contract):
    """
    Core attestation contract for content signatures
    """
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # BoxMap stores attestations: file_hash -> (creator_address, timestamp)
        self.attestations = BoxMap(Bytes, Attestation, key_prefix=b"a")
    
    @abimethod()
    def attest(self, file_hash: Bytes) -> Attestation:
        """
        Create immutable signature for content
        - Ensures first-to-sign-wins policy
        - Stores creator address and timestamp
        - Returns attestation struct
        """
        assert file_hash not in self.attestations, "Content already attested"
        
        new_attestation = Attestation(
            creator_address=Address(Txn.sender),
            timestamp=UInt64(Global.latest_timestamp)
        )
        
        self.attestations[file_hash] = new_attestation.copy()
        return new_attestation
```

**Key Features:**
- **Box Storage:** Dynamic key-value storage for attestations without predefined schema
- **ARC4 Compliance:** Standardized ABI method calls for interoperability
- **First-to-Sign-Wins:** Prevents duplicate attestations for same content
- **Immutable Records:** Permanent proof of creation and ownership

### How the Smart Contract Works

1. **Attestation Creation:**
   - User uploads file ‚Üí SHA-256 hash generated client-side
   - Hash sent to `attest()` method with ABI encoding
   - Contract checks if hash already exists (prevents duplicates)
   - Stores `Attestation(creator_address, timestamp)` in box storage
   - Returns attestation to user

2. **Box Storage Structure:**
   ```
   Key: b"a" + file_hash (33 bytes total)
   Value: creator_address (32 bytes) + timestamp (8 bytes)
   ```

3. **Verification Query:**
   - Query box storage with file hash
   - Decode attestation struct
   - Check Algorand Indexer for credential ASAs
   - Return verification result with organization info

4. **Credential System (Layer 2):**
   - Organizations create ASAs with `freeze` and `clawback` enabled
   - Non-transferable design prevents credential trading
   - Members opt-in to receive credentials
   - Verification checks if creator holds registered credential ASA

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rappid-exe/Veri-Sign-Submission.git
cd Veri-Sign-Submission
```

## üìñ How to Use

### Creating a Signature

1. **Connect Wallet** - Click "Connect Wallet" and approve in Pera Wallet
2. **Upload File** - Drag & drop or select any file
3. **Generate Hash** - SHA-256 hash created client-side
4. **Create Signature** - Approve transaction in Pera Wallet
5. **Confirmation** - View transaction details and block number

### Verifying Content

1. **Upload File** - Upload the file you want to verify
2. **Verify** - System generates hash and queries blockchain
3. **View Result** - See verification status with organization info
4. **Check Details** - View creator, timestamp, and transaction ID

### Managing Credentials (Admin)

1. **Create Credential ASA:**
   - Go to `/admin`
   - Enter organization name and description
   - Approve transaction to create ASA
   - Save the Asset ID

2. **Distribute Credentials:**
   - Recipient must opt-in first (enter Asset ID, approve transaction)
   - Enter Asset ID and recipient address
   - Approve distribution transaction
   - Credential now in recipient's wallet

3. **Enhanced Verification:**
   - Content signed by credentialed wallets shows organization name
   - "‚úì Verified by Reuters" instead of wallet address

## üé¨ Demo Workflow

### Scenario: Journalist Signs Breaking News Photo

1. **Setup (Organization):**
   - Reuters creates credential ASA
   - Distributes to verified journalist Sarah

2. **Content Creation (Journalist):**
   - Sarah photographs breaking news event
   - Signs photo using Veri-Sign web app
   - Photo hash stored on blockchain

3. **Verification (Reader):**
   - Reader sees photo on news website
